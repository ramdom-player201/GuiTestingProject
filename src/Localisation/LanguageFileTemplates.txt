Description of file format used by custom .lang files.

< comment > < ending bracket is not required, since comments are not multi-line

debug = "TRUE"
langDisplayName = "English (UK)"

< Data >

@ "Key" | "Text"      | < further localisation parameters can be added as third parameter >
@ "Key2" | "Text Two" |

< metadata is always read in specific order
< @ -- marks start of data entry
< " -- marks start or end of text (comments cannot be inside text)
< | -- optional separator

< Syntax errors are reported to debug, but do not actually halt execution, the program will simply handle errors and move to next entry
< If Key is intact but text is not, error will be written into text
